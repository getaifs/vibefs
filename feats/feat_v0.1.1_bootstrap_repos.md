Assuming that now you have the vibe binary installed, let's optimize the vibe init process.

Previously, we said that when we run `vibe init`, it should simply create the `.vibe` directory structure and populate it with the necessary files.

Now, we want to optimize this by also teaching coding agents how to interact with the VibeFS API. One way to do it is to add a short section to CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md, which will contain the documentation for the VibeFS API. This will allow agents to know from there on how to use the vibefs workflow.
