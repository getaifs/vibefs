This is Eric's local dev environment for VibeFS.

It's a fedora based immunitable Linux -- thus avoid getting any toolchains installed on it directly.

You are free to use distrobox to create a containerized dev environment and install toolchains there for this development.

Ideally the produced binary can be installed locally easily and be used to run VibeFS.

Anytime after you finish the work, try compile and test to verify.
